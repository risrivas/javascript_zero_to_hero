// Coding Challenge #2

/*
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
and height in meter).

Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
4. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message
is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
5. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's
BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"

Test data:
ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
m tall.
ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
m tall.
*/

const markWeight = 78;
const markHeight = 1.69;
// const markWeight = 95;
// const markHeight = 1.88;

const johnWeight = 92;
const johnHeight = 1.95;
// const johnWeight = 85;
// const johnHeight = 1.76;

const markBMI = markWeight / (markHeight ** 2);
const johnBMI = johnWeight / (johnHeight * johnHeight);

if (markBMI > johnBMI) {
    console.log(`Mark's BMI (${markBMI.toFixed(1)}) is higher than John's (${johnBMI.toFixed(1)})!`);
} else {
    console.log(`John's BMI (${johnBMI.toFixed(1)}) is higher than Mark's (${markBMI.toFixed(1)})!`);
}
